# Kubernetes (Helm) installation

This page explains how to install the AMD Network Device Plugin for Kubernetes using Helm.

## System requirements

- Kubernetes cluster v1.29.0 or later
- Helm v3.2.0 or later
- `kubectl` command-line tool configured with access to the cluster
- Nodes equipped with AMD AINICs
- AMD AINIC drivers, `nicctl` tool installed on the nodes (or bundled in image for multi-version support)
- A compatible CNI meta-plugin that supports additional network attachments (for example, Multus) installed and configured in the cluster
- The `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` custom resource definitions (CRDs) and associated RBAC available in the cluster

Refer to the [README](../../README.md) for more details on these runtime prerequisites and example configurations.

### Multi-Version Image Support

Starting with v1.2.1, container images support multiple nicctl versions bundled together. This allows a single image to work across clusters with different NIC firmware versions through automatic firmware detection at startup. See the [README Multi-Version nicctl Support](../../README.md#multi-version-nicctl-support) section for build details.

## Installation

### Add the AMD Helm Repository

```bash
helm repo add rocm-network-dp https://rocm.github.io/k8s-network-device-plugin
helm repo update
```

### Install the Helm chart

```bash
helm install amd-network-device-plugin rocm-network-dp/network-device-plugin-charts \
  --namespace kube-amd-network \
  --create-namespace \
  --version v1.2.1
```

### Verify the installation

Check that the DaemonSet pods are running on the expected nodes:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=device-plugin -n kube-amd-network
```

Once the pods are running, verify that node resources have been published:

```bash
kubectl get node <node-name> -o jsonpath='{.status.capacity}' | grep nic
```

Or inspect a specific node:

```bash
kubectl describe node <node-name>
```

## Configuration

To override default values, pass `--set key=value` on the command line or supply a custom values file via `-f my-values.yaml`. Refer to [`helm-charts-k8s/README.md`](../../helm-charts-k8s/README.md) for the full list of configurable values.

> **Note:** Ensure the Device Plugin image (`image.tag`) matches the AINIC firmware version installed on your nodes. Refer to the [Compatibility Matrix](../../README.md#compatibility-matrix) in the main README for the correct image version to use and configure the correct `image.tag` value in the values file.

### Example: custom tolerations

To schedule the Device Plugin DaemonSet pods on nodes with a custom taint, add the required toleration:

```bash
helm install amd-network-device-plugin rocm-network-dp/network-device-plugin-charts \
  --namespace kube-amd-network \
  --create-namespace \
  --version v1.2.1 \
  --set tolerations[0].key=example.com/foo \
  --set tolerations[0].operator=Exists \
  --set tolerations[0].effect=NoSchedule
```

Or via a values file:

```yaml
tolerations:
  - key: example.com/foo
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoSchedule
```

```bash
helm install amd-network-device-plugin rocm-network-dp/network-device-plugin-charts \
  --namespace kube-amd-network \
  --create-namespace \
  --version v1.2.1 \
  -f my-values.yaml
```

### Debugging

Use the `--debug` flag with `helm install` or `helm template` to see the fully rendered Kubernetes manifests with all values applied. This is useful for verifying that overrides are taking effect before deploying:

```bash
helm template amd-network-device-plugin rocm-network-dp/network-device-plugin-charts \
  --version v1.2.1 \
  --debug \
  -f my-values.yaml
```

Use `--dry-run` with `helm install` to simulate the installation without applying any resources to the cluster. Unlike `helm template`, a dry run communicates with the Kubernetes API server to validate the manifests against the cluster:

```bash
helm install amd-network-device-plugin rocm-network-dp/network-device-plugin-charts \
  --namespace kube-amd-network \
  --create-namespace \
  --version v1.2.1 \
  --dry-run \
  -f my-values.yaml
```

## Uninstallation

```bash
helm uninstall amd-network-device-plugin -n kube-amd-network
```

This removes all Kubernetes resources created by the chart, including the DaemonSet, ConfigMap, RBAC rules, and ServiceAccount. After the device plugin pods are removed and the plugin disconnects from the kubelet, the kubelet will eventually stop advertising the corresponding node resources.
